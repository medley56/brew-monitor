  control works!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start/Stop recording for a brew (shows up in Monitoring)</li>
  <li>Set target temperature timeline (daily temp? hourly? variable?)</li>
  <li>Opt to manually control fermentation</li>
  <li>Set email/text notifications based on gravity or temp. This will require a user profile to be set somehow.</li>
</ul>
